Main Plans for the application
Pokedex app
    Main Page
        Actual Pokedex Screen
            should show the number of pokemon but no names
    
    Individual Pokemon Page
        Most important information about the pokemon
            name
            type
            picture of pokemon
    Detailed Pokemon Page  
        All the details of the pokemon
        Should be directed from the individual pokemon Page
    
    Later Ideas
        Click a button that pulls up a random pokemon
        Choose to run or catch
        catching pokemon puts into pokedex
        Sort the pokeedex in different ways
        
    


Backend
    We can access the pokemon data through the application 
    Our backend purpose is to save the data on which pokemon were found and save this data
    Create database using MondoDB
    {
        user: {username: name;
                password: password;
                }
        pokemon owned: []
        pokemon seen: []
    }
